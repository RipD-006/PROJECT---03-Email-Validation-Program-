# PROJECT---03-Email-Validation-Program-
This Python project is designed to validate email addresses by checking their format and ensuring they adhere to standard email conventions, correct format, valid domain, and syntax rules commonly used for Email Addresses. Throughout a series of Conditional Statements the goal of the project is to help users determine whether a given email address is valid or not before attempting to send emails. The validation process helps identify invalid emails, reducing the chances of sending messages to non existent or incorrectly formatted addresses.

# Features:
1) SYNTAX VALIDATION: The project checks whether the email follows the standard structure, including a local part, an "@" symbol, and a domain part (i.e. username@domain.com).
2) DOMAIN VALIDATION: The system checks whether the domain part of the email corresponds to a real domain.
3) EMAIL FORMAT SUGGESTIONS: If the email address is invalid the system can provide suggestions for correcting common mistakes (i.e. Missing "@"; Incorrect Domain; or Invalid Characters.
4) USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE: A simple and interactive command-line interface (CLI) is available to input Email Addresses, with clear success or error messages indicating the result of the validation check.
