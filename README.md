# PROJECT---03-Email-Validation-Program-
This Python project is designed to validate email addresses by checking their format and ensuring they adhere to standard email conventions, correct format, valid domain, and syntax rules commonly used for Email Addresses. Throughout a series of Conditional Statements the goal of the project is to help users determine whether a given email address is valid or not before attempting to send emails. The validation process helps identify invalid emails, reducing the chances of sending messages to non existent or incorrectly formatted addresses.
